However, before stating such a conclusion, I wanted to check whether each dog stage is equally represented in the dataset. I found that there are 257 puppers, 97 doggos, 30 puppos and 10 floofers. So, it seems that dog stages are highly imbalanced. So in order to make a decision of which dog stage is most rated I would suggest the need for hypothesis testing."
